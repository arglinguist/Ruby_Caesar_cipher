# Ruby Caesar Cipher
#### by arglinguist
## Description
A Caesar cipher is a cryptography tool by which a word or phrase is encoded by replacing all letters with a letter a certain number of steps away in the alphabet. A shift of 5 would change "A" to "F" and "Hi there!" to "Mn ymjwj!"
This is a simple interactive program that asks the user for a phrase and shift value and prints the resulting (encoded) message.
